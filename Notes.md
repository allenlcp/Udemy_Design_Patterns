## Overview
23 design patterns 
* Divided into 3 types (gang of four) - organised by purpose (reflects what a pattern does)
    * Creational - concern the process of object creation
    * Structural - deal with the composition of classes or objects
    * Behavioral - characterize the ways in which classes or objects interact and distribute responsibility

* Design patterns can also be organised by scope (whether the pattern applies primarily to classes or to objects)
    * class patterns deal with relationships between classes and their subclasses - these relationships are established through inheritance
    * object patterns deal with object relationships, which can be changed at run-time and are more dynamic - describes how objects can be composed into larger structure using object composition or by including objects within other objects


## **Software Design Principles**

**Programming to an interface**
* the word interface is overloaded
    * there is the concept of interface, but there is also the Java construct interface
    * you can program to an interface, without having to actually use a Java interface

* "Program to an interface" really means "Program to a supertype"
    * the declared type of the var should be a supertype, usually an abstract class or interface
    * the objects assigned to those var can be of any concrete implementation of the supertype
    * the class declaring them doesn't have to know about the actual object types

* Do not declare var to be instances of a particular concrete class
    * instead, commit only to an interface defined by an abstract class (interface or abstract)

* always program for the interface and not for the implementation
    * will lead to flexible code which can work with any new implementation of the interface

* manipulating objects solely in terms of the interface is beneficial to clients
    * clients do not need to know the specific types of objects they use - as long as the objects adhere to the interface that clients expect
    * clients do not need to know the classes that implement these objects - they only know about the abstract class(es) defining the interface

* we can use interface types on var, return types of methods or parameter types in a method

* the point is to exploit polymorphism by programming to a supertype so that the actual runtime object is not locked into the code
___
**Abstract Classes vs Interfaces**
    * with support of default methods interfaces since the launch of Java 8, the gap between when to use an interface and when to use an abstract classes has been reduced

    * var in interfaces are **public static final** 
    * abstract classes can have other access modifiers for variables (private, protected, etc..

    * methods in interfaces are **public or public static**
    * methods in abstract classes can be private and protected too

    * utilize abstract classes to establish a relationship between interrelated objects - when you want to share code among several closely related classes then this common state or behavior can be put in the abstract class
    * utilize interfaces to establish a relationship between unrelated classes - the interfaces Comparable and Cloaneable are implemented by many unrelated classes
    * utilize interfaces if you want to specify the behavior of a particular data type, but are not concerned about who implements its behavior
    * utilize interfaces if you want to take advantage of multiple inheritance (implements)

    * **one is not better than the other**

    * you might create an interface and then have an abstract class implement that interface

``` java
interface displayModule{
    public void display();
}

class Monitor implements  displayModule {
    public void display() {
        System.out.println("Display through Monitor");
    }
}

class Projector implements  displayModule {
    public void display() {
        System.out.println("Display through Projector");
    }
}

public class Computer{
    displayModule dm;

    public void setDisplayModule(displayModule dm) {
        this.dm = dm;
    }

    public void display(){
        dm.display();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Computer cm = new Computer();
        displayModule dm1 = new Monitor();
        displayModule dm2 = new Projector();
        cm.setDisplayModule(dm1);
        cm.display();
        cm.setDisplayModule(dm2);
        cm.display();
    }
}
```
___

**Composition vs Inheritance**

Composition
* composition is refereed as a HAS-A relationship between classes in OO design - an object contains(owns) another object as a member var of its class

* composition implies a relationship where the child cannot exist independent of the parent
    * something is part of another thing (wheels on an airplane)
    * rooms in a house - each house has a room or many rooms, rooms do not exist separate to a house
    * cells in a body - when the body object is destroyed, the cells get destroyed with it

Aggregation
* aggregation is a HAS-A relationship between objects and is closely related to composition
* aggregation implies a relationship where the child can exist independently of the parent 
    * a collection of things that are not part of it
    * airplanes at an airport
    * student in a class -get rid of the class and the students still exist
    * tires on a car - the tires can be taken off of the car and installed on a different one

* aggregation and composition are almost completely identical except that composition is used when the life of the child is completely controlled by the parent
    * the distinction loses much of its importance in languages that have garbage collection  - you do not have to concern yourself with the life of the object

* favoring obj composition over class inheritance helps you keep each class encapsulated and focused on one task
* your classes and class hierarchies will remain small and will be less likely to grow into unmanageable monsters

* inheritance breaks encapsulation because sub classes are dependent upon the base class behavior
    * inheritance is tightly coupled whereas composition is loosely coupled
    * when behavior of super class changes, functionality in sub class may get broken, without any change on its part

* java does not support multiple inheritance

* better test-ability
    * tdd - test driven development

* composition allows for code reuse from final classes - impossible with inheritance because you cannot extend a final class in Java

___

**Delegation Principles**
* delegation is the concept of one class "delegating" its behavior to another class
    * don't do all stuff by yourself, delegate it to a respective class
    * when you delegate, you are simply calling up some class which knows what must be done
    * don not really care how it does it, all you care about is that the class you are calling knows what it needs to do

* delegation can be viewed as a relationship between objects where one object forwards certain method calls to another object, called its delegate

* delegation is an extreme example of object composition
    * shows that you can always replace inheritance with object composition as a mechanism for code reuse
    * delegation means that you use an object of another class as an instance variable, and forward messages to the instance

* it is better than inheritance for many cases
    * it makes you to think about each message you forward - the instance is of a known class, rather than a new class
    * it does not force you to accept all the methods of the super class - you can provide only the methods that really make sense

Advantages
* the primary adv of delegation is run-time flexibility - it makes it easy to compose behaviors at run-time and to change the way they are composed
* delegation is a good design only when it simplifies more than it complicates
    * how effective it will be depends on the context and on how much experience you have with it
    * delegation works best when it is used in design patterns
* several design patterns use delegation:
    * State - an object delegates requests to a State object that represents its current state
    * Strategy - an object delegates a specific request to an object that represents a strategy for carrying out the request
    * Visitor - the operation that gets performed on each element of an object structure is always delegated to the Visitor object


Examples
* the equals() and hashCode() method in Java is a classic example of delegation - in order to compare 2 objects for equality, we ask the class itself to do comparison instead of client class doing that check

* event delegation is another example - an event is delegated to handlers for handling

``` java
class RealPrinter{
    // the "delegate"
    void print(){
        System.out.println("The Delegate");
    }
}

class Printer{
    // the "delegator"
    RealPrinter p = new RealPrinter();

    // create the delegate
    void print(){
        p.print();
    }
}

public class DelegationExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // To the outside world it looks like Printer actually prints
        Printer printer = new Printer();
        printer.print();
    }
}
```
___


## **Single Responsibility**
* states that every class should have responsibility over a single part of the functionality provided by the software
    * the responsibility should be entirely encapsulated by the class
    * all its methods should be narrowly aligned with that responsibility
    * a class should have only one job

* a class should have a single responsibility, where a responsibility is nothing but a reason to change

* should make sure that one class at most is responsible for doing one task or functionality among the whole set of responsibilities that it has
    * only when theres is change needed in that specific task or functionality should this class be changed

* the single responsibility principle is closely related to the concepts of coupling and cohesion

**Coupling** is the degree of interdependence between software classes or methods
    * a measure of how closely connected two classes or two methods are
    * the strength of the relationship between classes

* low coupling means small dependencies between classes/methods
    * easier to change code without introducing bugs in other classes or other methods

* tight coupling means two classes/methods are closely connected
    * a change in one module may affect another module

* cohesion refers to what the class (or method) can do

**Cohesion** refers to what the class (or method) can do

* low cohesion would mean that the class does a great variety of actions
    * it is broad, unfocused on what it should do

* high cohesion means that the class is focused on what it should be doing 
    * contains only methods relating to the intention of the class

* The single responsibility principle is about limiting the impact of change by designing loosely(low) coupled classes that are highly cohesive

Examples of responsibilities
* some examples of responsibilities to consider that may need to be separated include:
    * Persistence
    * Class Selection / Instantiation
    * Validation
    * Formatting
    * Notification
    * Parsing
    * Error Handling
    * Mapping
    * Logging


``` java
class Employee{
    private String employeeId;
    private String name;
    private String address;
    private Date dateOfJoining;

    public boolean isPromotionDueThisYear(){ // -    * hr responsiblity
        // promotion logic
    }

    public double calcIncomeTaxForCurrentYear(){  // -    * finance responsibility
        // income tax logic
    }

    // getters / setters for all member variables
}
```
* refactored
``` java
class Employee{
    private String employeeId;
    private String name;
    private String address;
    private Date dateOfJoining;

    // getters / setters for all member variables
}
```
``` java
public class HRPromotions {
    public boolean isPromotionDueThisYear(Employee emp){
        // promotion logic implementation is using the employee info passed in
    }
}
``` java
public class Finance {
    public double calcIncomeTaxForCurrentYear(Employee emp){
        // income tax logic using employee passed in
    }
}
```
___

## **Open Closed Principle**

* Bertrand Meyer proposed the open-closed principle (OCP)
    * classes and methods should be open for extension (new functionality) and closed for modification
    * a class should be easily extendable without modifying the class itself

* a module is said to open if it is still available for extension
    * it should be possible to add fields to the data structures it contains, or new elements to the set of functions it performs

* a module is said to be closed if it is available for use by other modules
    * assumes that the module has been given a well-defined, stable description
    * the interface in the sense of information hiding (not a java interface)

* a general idea of this principle is that it tells you to write your code so that you will be able to add new functionality without changing the existing code
    * prevents situations in which a change to one of your classes also requires you to adapt all depending classes
    * reduces tight coupling

* Robert C. Marting considered this principle as the "most important principle of OO design"

* unfortunately, Bertrand Mayer proposed the use of inheritance to achieve the open/closed principle

* however, inheritance introduces tight coupling if the subclasses depend on implementation details of their parent class

* others redefined the Open/Closed Principle to the Polymorphic Open/Closed Principle
    * uses interfaces instead of super classes to allow different implementation
    * interfaces can be reused through inheritance but implementation need not be
    * can easily substitute without changing the code that uses them - multiple implementations can be created and polymorphically substituted for each other

* interfaces are closed for modifications
    * you can provide new implementations to extend the functionality of your software
    * new implementations must implement the interface

* interfaces introduce an additional level of abstraction which enables loose coupling
    * interfaces are independent of each other and don't need to share any code (usually)

Problem - every time we have a new shape we need to modify the AreaCalculator class with a new method
``` java
class AreaCalculator{
    public double calculateRectangleArea(Rectangle rectangle){
        return rectangle.length * rectangle.width;
    }
    public double calculateCircleArea(Circle circle){
        return (22/7) * circle.radius * circle.radius;
    }
}

class Rectangle{
    public double length;
    public double width;
}

class Circle{
    public double radius;
}
```

* Refactor - use interface and have each class implement specifics
    * open for extension by implementing interface
    * close for modification
    * example also use delegation and polymorphism

``` java
interface Shape{
    double calculateArea();
}

class Rectangle implements Shape{
    public double length;
    public double width;

    public double calculateArea() {
        return length * width;
    }
}

class Circle implements Shape{
    public double radius;

    public double calculateArea() {
        return (22/7) * radius * radius;
    }
}

class AreaCalculator{
    public double calculateShapeArea(Shape shape){
        return shape.calculateArea();
    }
}
```

## **Liskov Substition Principle**
* was introduced by Barbara Liskov

* the principle defines that objects of a superclass can be replaceable with objects of its superclasses without breaking the application
    * requires the objects of your subclasses to behave in the same way as the objects of your superclass
    * methods which use a superclass type must be able to work with the subclass without any issues

* an overridden method of a subclass needs to accept the same input parameter values as the method of the superclass
    * do not implement any stricter validation rules on input parameters than implemented by the parent class
    * any code that calls this method on an object of the superclass might cause an exception, if it gets called with an object of the subclass

* the return value of a method of the subclass needs to comply with the same rules as the return value of the method of the superclass
    * you can only decide to apply strict rules by returning a specific subclass of the defined return value or by returning a subset of the valid return values of the superclass

* in order to follow LSP the subclass must enhance functionality, but not reduce functionality
___

## **Interface Segregation Principle**
* was defined by Robert C. Martin

* "Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use"
    * a client should not implement an interface if it does not use a method in that interface
    * happens mostly when one interface contains more than one functionality, and the client only needs one fuctionality and not the other

* the goal of the interface segregation principle is to reduce the side effects and frequency of required changes by splitting the software into multiple, independent parts

* interface design is a tricky job because you release your interface you can not change it without breaking all implementation

* using the interface keyword in Java means that you have to implement all of the methods in the interface before any class can use it.
    * if you follow this principle in Java, you will implement less methods because each interface will have a single functionality

* if we created a single interface then all clients will have to unnecessarily implement all other clients' methods just to make their interface compile
    * this is referred to as a "fat" interface
    * makes the overall design rigid due to the enormous effort required to manage changes across all clients when making a change to a method pertaining to only one client

* it avoids the design drawbacks associated with a fat interface by refactoring each fat interface into multiple segregated interfaces
    * each segregate interface is a lean interface as it only contains methods which are required for a specific client

* a lean interface does not mean one method per interface

* a lean interface caters to a consumers of a specific type of functionality or a specific set of customers all of whom have the same functional needs


Example 1 - Problem - this interface does not cater for flat shapes e.g circle does not have volume
``` java
interface ShapeInterface{
    double area();  
    double volume();  
}
```
Refactored - split the interface
``` java
interface ShapeInterface{
    double area();
}

interface SolidShapeInterface{
    double volume();
}

class Cube implements  ShapeInterface, SolidShapeInterface{
    @Override
    public double area() {
        // calculate the surface area of the cuboid
        return 1.0;
    }

    @Override
    public double volume() {
        // calculate the volume of the cuboid
        return 1.0;
    }
}
```
Refactored - added interface for calculate() -    * this consumer will only see calculate
``` java 

interface ShapeInterface{
    double area();
}

interface SolidShapeInterface{
    double volume();
}

interface ManagedShapeInterface{
    public double calculate();
}

class Cube implements  ShapeInterface, SolidShapeInterface, ManagedShapeInterface{
    @Override
    public double area() {
        // calculate the surface area of the cuboid
        return 1.0;
    }

    @Override
    public double volume() {
        // calculate the volume of the cuboid
        return 1.0;
    }

    @Override
    public double calculate() {
        return this.area() + this.volume();
    }
}

class Square implements ShapeInterface, ManagedShapeInterface{
    @Override
    public double area() {
        return 2.0;
    }

    @Override
    public double calculate() {
        return this.area();
    }
}
```


Example 2 - Problem - client need to implement all methods 
``` java 
interface RestaurantInterface{
    void acceptOnlineOrder();
    void takeTelephoneOrder();
    void payOnline();
    void walkInCustomerOrder();
    void payInPerson();
}

class OnlineClientImpl implements RestaurantInterface{
    @Override
    public void acceptOnlineOrder() {}

    @Override
    public void takeTelephoneOrder() {}

    @Override
    public void payOnline() {}

    @Override
    public void walkInCustomerOrder() {}

    @Override
    public void payInPerson() {}
}
```

Refactored
* separated interface into
    * payments type
    * online orders
    * walk-in orders

___

## **Dependency Inversion**
* no var should hold a reference to a concrete class - use the factory design pattern to avoid this
* no class should subclass from a concrete class
    * if you subclass from a concrete class, you are depending on a concrete class
    * subclass from an abstraction (an interface or an abstract class)

* no method should override an implemented method of any of its base classes
    * if you override an implemented method, then your base class was not really an abstraction to start with
    * methods implemented in the base class are meant to be shared by all your subclasses

* this is a guideline you should strive for, rather than a rule you should follow all the time
    * if you have a class that is not likely to change, and you know it, then it is ok to instantiate a concrete class
    * we instantiate String objects all the time and this violates the principle - however, the String class is very unlikely to change

___

## **Dependency Injection**

**Dependencies**
* a Java class has a dependency on another class, if it uses an instance of this class
    * referred to as a class dependency
    * a class which accesses a logger service has a dependency on this service class

* java classes should be as independent as possible from another Java classes 
    * increases the possibility of reusing these classes and to be able to test them independently from other classes

* if a java class creates an instance of another class via the new operator, it cannot be uses (and tested) independently from this class - this is called a hard dependency

* dependency injection solves these "hard" dependencies


**Dependency Injection**
* dependency injection is a tech whereby one object supplies the dependencies of another object - enables you to replace dependencies without changing the class that uses them

* a dependency is an object that can be used (a service)

* an injection is the passing of a dependency to a dependent object (a client) that would use it

* allows us to remove the hard-coded dependencies and make our application loosely coupled, extendable and maintainable

* dependency injection is one form of the broader technique of dependency inversion
- supports the dependency inversion principle

* the client delegates the responsibility of providing its dependencies to external code (the injector)


**4 Roles in Dependency Injection**
* if you want to use the DI, you need classes that fulfill 4 basic role
    * the service you want to use
    * the client that uses the service
    * an interface that is used by the client and implemented by the service
    * the injector which creates a service instance and injects it into the client

* you already implement 3 of these 4 roles by following the dependency inversion principle - the service and client are the 2 classes between which the dependency inversion principle intends to remove the dependency by introducing an interface

* the injector is the only role that is not required by the dependency inversion principle


**Injection Types**
* constructor injection - the dependencies are provided through a class constructor
``` java
// Constructor
Client(Service service){
    // save the ref to the passed-in service inside the client
    this.service = service;
}

```

* setter injection - the client exposes a setter method that the injector uses to inject the dependency
``` java
// Setter method
public void setService(Service service){
    // save the ref to the passed-in service inside the client
    this.service = service;
}
```

* interface injection 
    * the dependency provides an injector method that will inject the dependency into any client passed to it
    * clients must implement an interface that exposes a setter method that accepts the dependency

``` java
// Service setter interface
public interface ServiceSetter{
    public void setService(Service service);
}

public class Service{
    void inject(Client c){
        c.setService(this);
    }
}

// Client class
public class Client implements ServiceSetter{
    // Internal ref to the service used by this client.
    private ServiceSetter;

    // Set the service that this client is to be use
    @Override
    public void serService(Service service){
        this.service = service;
    }
}
```

## **Creational Design Patterns**
* a program should not depend on how objects are created and arranged

* instantiation is an activity that should not always be done in public and can often lead to coupling problems

* In Java, the simplest way to create an instance of an object is by using the new operator
    * fred = new Fred(); //instance of Fred class
    * creates a concrete class

* Tying your code to a concrete class can make it more fragile and less flexible
    * code may have to be changed as new concrete classes are added
    * your code will not be "closed for modification" to extend it with new concrete types, you will have to reopen it

* creational design patterns provide a way to create objects

* creational design patterns abstract the instantiation process
    * the creation logic is hidden
    * encapsulates knowledge about which concrete classes the system uses
    * programmer may call a method or use another object, rather than instantiating objects directly using the new operator

* all the system at large knows about the objects is their interface as defined by abstract classes
    * gives the programmer a lot of flexibility in what gets created, who creates it, how it gets created, and when
    * lets you configure a systems with "product" objects that vary widely in structure and functionality
    * configuration can be static (compile-time) or dynamic (at run-time)

* by coding to an interface, you can insulate yourself from a lot of changes that might happen to a system down the road
* sometimes creational patterns are competitors
    * there are cases either Prototype or Abstract Factory could be used profitably

    * sometimes creational patterns are complementary
    * builder can use one of the other patterns to implement which components get built
    * prototype can use Singleton in its implementation


**Class Patterns vs. Object Patterns (sub-categories)**
* class patterns describe how relationships between classes are defined
    * use inheritance
    * relationships are established at compile time
    * factory pattern
    * drawback of this approach is that it can require creating a new subclass just to change the class of the product - changes can cascade when the product creator is itself created by a factory method, then you have to override its creator as well

* object patterns describe relationships between objects
    * use composition
    * relationships are typically created at runtime - more dynamic and flexible
    * abstract factory, singleton, builder, and prototype patterns

___

## **1. Factory**
* one of the most used design patterns in Java
    * a creational pattern
    * factories handle the details of object creation

* this pattern defines an interface for creating an object (Creator)

* when a class needs to instantiate a subclass of another class, but doesn't know which one - it lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate

* creates objects without exposing the creation logic to the client (Creator) and refers to the newly created object using a common interface (Product)

* gives us a way to encapsulate the instantiations of concrete types

Frameworks
* the factory method is used in frameworks
    * frameworks exist at an abstraction level

* frameworks uses abstract classes to define and maintain relationships between objects
    * often responsible for creating these objects as well

* the framework should not know and should not be concerned about instantiating specific objects 
    * need to defer the decisions about specific objects to the users of the framework

* use the Factory Method pattern when
    * a class cannot anticipate the class of objects it must create
    * a class wants its subclasses to specify the objects it creates

* also useful when implementing parallel class hierarchies 
    * when some of the responsibilities shift from one class to another

**(a) Factory Method Implementation (Abstract Creator)**
* It is the "strictest" implementation of the pattern
    * the creator class is an abstract class
    * you create a subclass of the creator class for each product type which contains an implementation of the factory method
    * to use the factory method(create objects). you simply specify an instance of that type and invoke the factory method

* the disadvantage of this approach is that every product has to subclass the creator class and implement its factory method

* product is the interface for the type of object that the Factory Method creates

* creator is the interface that defines the Factory Method
    * any other methods implemented here are written to operate on products produces by the factory method
    * the creator class is written without knowledge of the actual products taht will be created

* clients will need to subclass the Creator class to make a particular concrete product 
    * only subclasses actually implement the factory method and creates products

* the actual products that will be created is decided purely by the choice of the subclass that is used

``` java
public interface Shape {
    void draw();
}

class Rectangle implements Shape{
    @Override
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Inside Rectangle::draw() method");
    }
}

class Circle implements Shape{
    @Override
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Inside Circle::draw() method");
    }
}
```
* factory 
``` java
public abstract class AbstractShapeFactory {
    protected abstract Shape factoryMethod();

    public Shape getShape(){
        return factoryMethod();
    }

    // other helper methods
}

class RectangleFactory extends AbstractShapeFactory{
    @Override
    protected Shape factoryMethod() {
        return new Rectangle();
    }
}

class CircleFactory extends AbstractShapeFactory{
    @Override
    protected Shape factoryMethod() {
        return new Circle();
    }
}

class SquareFactory extends AbstractShapeFactory{
    @Override
    protected Shape factoryMethod() {
        return new Square();
    }
}
```
* client
``` java
public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        //get an object of Circle and call its draw method
        Shape shape1 = new CircleFactory().getShape();
        shape1.draw();

        //get an object of Circle and call its draw method
        Shape shape2 = new RectangleFactory().getShape();
        shape2.draw();

        //get an object of Circle and call its draw method
        Shape shape3 = new SquareFactory().getShape();
        shape3.draw();
    }
}

**(b) Factory Method Implementation (Concrete Creator)**
* this implementation includes creating a single concrete creator class
    * the creator class is concrete class
    * you add implementation code to one factory method to create your product type bases on a parameter passed to the method
    * to use the factory method (create objects), you create an instance of the creator class and invoke the factory method with an argument for your "class type"

* the advantage of this approach is that you do not need to create a new subclass of the abstract creator class and implement a new factory method

Example 1
* factory
``` java
public class ShapeFactory {
    // use getShape method to get object
    public Shape getShape(String shapeType){
        if(shapeType == null){
            return null;
        } else if (shapeType.equalsIgnoreCase("CIRCLE")){
            return new Circle();
        } else if (shapeType.equalsIgnoreCase("RECTANGLE")){
            return new Rectangle();
        } else if (shapeType.equalsIgnoreCase("SQUARE")){
            return new Square();
        }

        return  null;
    }
}
```
client
``` java
public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ShapeFactory shapeFactory = new ShapeFactory();

        // get an object of Circle and call its draw method
        Shape shape1 = shapeFactory.getShape("CIRCLE");
        shape1.draw();

        // get an object of Circle and call its draw method
        Shape shape2 = shapeFactory.getShape("RECTANGLE");
        shape2.draw();

        // get an object of Circle and call its draw method
        Shape shape3 = shapeFactory.getShape("SQUARE");
        shape3.draw();
    }
}
```

Exmaple 2
``` java
public interface AnimalInterface {
    void walk();
    void eat();
}

class Tiger implements AnimalInterface{
    @Override
    public void walk() {
        System.out.println("Tiger::walk() method");
    }

    @Override
    public void eat() {
        System.out.println("Tiger::eat() method");
    }
}

class Duck implements AnimalInterface{
    @Override
    public void walk() {
        System.out.println("Duck::walk() method");
    }

    @Override
    public void eat() {
        System.out.println("Duck::eat() method");
    }
}
```
factory
``` java
public abstract class AnimalFactoryInterface {
    public abstract AnimalInterface getAnimalType(String type) throws Exception;
}


class ConcreteFactory extends AnimalFactoryInterface {
    @Override
    public AnimalInterface getAnimalType(String animalType) throws Exception {

        switch (animalType){
            case "Duck":
                return new Duck();
            case "Tiger":
                return new Tiger();
            default:
                throw new Exception("Animal type: " + animalType + " cannot be instantiated");
        }
    }
}
```
client
``` java
public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception{

        AnimalFactoryInterface animalFactory = new ConcreteFactory();

        AnimalInterface animal1 = animalFactory.getAnimalType("Duck");
        animal1.eat();
        animal1.walk();

        AnimalInterface animal2 = animalFactory.getAnimalType("Tiger");
        animal2.eat();
        animal2.walk();
    }
}
```

**(c) Factory Method Implementation (Static Method)**
* 3rd implementation of the factory method pattern includes the use of a static method
* define a factory as a static method is a common technique - often called a static factory
* this technique is sometimes used so that you do not need to instantiate an object to make use of the create method
* it has the disadvantage that you cannot subclass and change the behavior of the create method

factory
``` java
public class ShapeFactory {
    // use getShape method to get object
    public static Shape getShape(String shapeType){
        if(shapeType == null){
            return null;
        } else if (shapeType.equalsIgnoreCase("CIRCLE")){
            return new Circle();
        } else if (shapeType.equalsIgnoreCase("RECTANGLE")){
            return new Rectangle();
        } else if (shapeType.equalsIgnoreCase("SQUARE")){
            return new Square();
        }
        return  null;
    }
}
```
client
``` java
public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // get an object of Circle and call its draw method
        Shape shape1 = ShapeFactory.getShape("CIRCLE");
        shape1.draw();

        // get an object of Circle and call its draw method
        Shape shape2 = ShapeFactory.getShape("RECTANGLE");
        shape2.draw();

        // get an object of Circle and call its draw method
        Shape shape3 = ShapeFactory.getShape("SQUARE");
        shape3.draw();
    }
}
```

## **2. Abstract Factory**
**Overview**
* the abstract factory provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes
    * "factory of factories"
    * super factory that creates other factories

* a pattern that creates objects via abstraction (does not care how its products are created)

* the methods of an Abstract Factory are implemented as factory methods
    * provides an encapsulation mechanism to a group of individual factories
    * factory method is a subset of this pattern

* there is often one concrete class implemented for each family

**When to use it**
* when a system should be independent of how its products are created, compose, and represented

* when we need to deal with multiple factories

* when the problem domain has different families of objects present and each family is used under different circumstances

* when a family of related product objects is designed to be used together, and you need to enforce this constraint

* when you want to provide a class lib of products, and want to reveal just their interfaces, not their implementations


**Summary**
* all factories encapsulate object creation

* Factory Method relies on inheritance
    * object creation is delegated to subclasses, which implement the factory method to create objects

* Abstract Factory relies on object composition
    * object creation is implemented in methods exposed in the factory interface

* all factory patterns promote loose coupling by reducing the dependency of your application on concrete classes

* the intent of Factory Method is to allow a class to defer instantiation to its subclasses

* the intent of Abstract Factory is to create families of related objects without having to depend on their concrete classes

* objects - shape family
``` java
public interface Shape {
    void draw();
}

class Rectangle implements Shape {
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Inside Rectangle::draw() method");
    }
}

class Circle implements Shape {
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Inside Circle::draw() method");
    }
}

class Square implements Shape {
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Inside Square::draw() method");
    }
}
```
* object - color family
``` java
public interface Color {
    void fill();
}


class Red implements Color{
    public void fill() {
        System.out.println("Red:: fill() method");
    }
}

class Blue implements Color{
    public void fill() {
        System.out.println("Blue:: fill() method");
    }
}

class Green implements Color{
    public void fill() {
        System.out.println("Green:: fill() method");
    }
}
```
* object - factories
``` java
public abstract class AbstractFactory {
    abstract Color getColor(String color);
    abstract Shape getShape(String shape);
}

class ShapeFactory extends AbstractFactory{
    Shape getShape(String shapeType) {
        if(shapeType == null){
            return null;
        } else if (shapeType.equalsIgnoreCase("CIRCLE")){
            return new Circle();
        } else if (shapeType.equalsIgnoreCase("RECTANGLE")){
            return new Rectangle();
        } else if (shapeType.equalsIgnoreCase("SQUARE")){
            return new Square();
        }

        return  null;
    }

    Color getColor(String color) {
        return null;
    }

}

class ColorFactory extends AbstractFactory{
    Color getColor(String colorType) {
        if(colorType == null){
            return null;
        } else if (colorType.equalsIgnoreCase("RED")){
            return new Red();
        } else if (colorType.equalsIgnoreCase("GREEN")){
            return new Green();
        } else if (colorType.equalsIgnoreCase("BLUE")){
            return new Blue();
        }

        return  null;
    }

    Shape getShape(String shape) {
        return null;
    }
}
```
* factory of factory
``` java
public class FactoryProducer {
    public static AbstractFactory getFactory(String choice){
        if(choice.equalsIgnoreCase("SHAPE")){
            return new ShapeFactory();
        }

        if(choice.equalsIgnoreCase("COLOR")){
            return new ColorFactory();
        }

        return null;
    }
}
```
* client
``` java
public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        AbstractFactory shapeFactory = FactoryProducer.getFactory("Shape");
        Shape shape1 = shapeFactory.getShape("Circle");
        shape1.draw();
        Shape shape2 = shapeFactory.getShape("Square");
        shape2.draw();
        Shape shape3 = shapeFactory.getShape("Rectangle");
        shape3.draw();


        AbstractFactory colorFactory = FactoryProducer.getFactory("Color");
        Color color1 = colorFactory.getColor("Red");
        color1.fill();
        Color color2 = colorFactory.getColor("Blue");
        color2.fill();
        Color color3 = colorFactory.getColor("Green");
        color3.fill();
    }
}
```

## **3. Singleton**
Singleton pattern is one of the simplest design patterns in java - it comes under creational pattern as this pattern provides one of the best ways to create an object

Ensures a class only has one instance, and provide a global point of access to it

We are taking class and letting it manage a single instance of itself
> also preventing any other class from creating a new instance on its own
> to get an instance, you have got to go through the class itself

We are also providing a global access point to the instance
> whenever you need an instance, just query the class and it will hand you back the single instance
> a global variable makes an object accessible, but it does not keep you from instantiating multiple objects

**Adv / Disadv of the singleton**
Controlled access to sole instance
> because the Singleton class encapsulates its sole instance, it can have strict control over how and when clients access it

Reduced name space
> an improvement over global variables
> avoids polluting the name space with global variables that store sole instances

Permits a variable number of instances
> makes it easy to change your mind and allow more than one instance of the Singleton class

Singletons hinder unit testing
> might cause issues for writing testable code if the object and the methods associated with it are so tightly coupled that it becomes impossible to test without writing a fully functional class dedicated to the Singleton

Singletons create hidden dependencies
> because it is readily available throughout the code base, it can be overused
> since its reference is not completely transparent while passing to different methods, it becomes difficult to track
